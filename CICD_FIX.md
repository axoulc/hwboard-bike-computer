# CI/CD Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because it couldn't find the KiCad project files. The workflow was looking for files in the root directory, but they are actually located in the `PCB/` subdirectory.

## 🔍 Root Cause

### Incorrect File Paths
The workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/kibot.yml` specified:
```yaml
schema: 'hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch'
board: 'hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb'
```

### Actual File Locations
The files are actually located at:
- `PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch`
- `PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb`

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/kibot.yml`

Changed:
```yaml
schema: 'hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch'
board: 'hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb'
```

To:
```yaml
schema: 'PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch'
board: 'PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb'
```

### 2. Updated Makefile
**File:** `Makefile`

Changed:
```makefile
SCHEMATIC = hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch
PCB = hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb
```

To:
```makefile
SCHEMATIC = PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch
PCB = PCB/hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/kibot.yml Makefile
   git commit -m "fix: Update file paths to PCB subdirectory in CI/CD workflow"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify the workflow runs successfully:**
   - Go to the Actions tab on GitHub
   - Check that the new workflow run completes without errors
   - Download and verify the generated artifacts

3. **Test locally (optional):**
   ```bash
   make check
   make schematics
   ```

## 📋 What Was Wrong

The workflow was failing with an error similar to:
```
Error: Could not find schematic file: hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch
```

Or:
```
Error: Could not find PCB file: hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb
```

## ✨ Expected Result

After this fix, the CI/CD workflow should:
- ✅ Successfully locate the KiCad files in the `PCB/` directory
- ✅ Generate all outputs (schematics, PCB renders, BOM, Gerbers, etc.)
- ✅ Upload artifacts for download
- ✅ Complete without errors

## 🔧 Additional Notes

### Project Structure
The repository has the following structure:
```
hwboard-bike-computer/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── kibot.yml          # ✅ Fixed
├── PCB/
│   ├── hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_sch  # Actual schematic
│   ├── hwboard-bike-computer.kicad_pcb  # Actual PCB
│   ├── hwboard-cpu.kicad_sch
│   └── ...
├── hwboard.kibot.yaml         # KiBot configuration
├── Makefile                   # ✅ Fixed
└── ...
```

### Why This Happened
The initial setup assumed the KiCad files would be in the root directory, but the actual project structure has them in a `PCB/` subdirectory. This is a common organizational pattern for hardware projects.

### Future Considerations
If you reorganize the project structure in the future, remember to update:
1. `.github/workflows/kibot.yml` - schema and board paths
2. `Makefile` - SCHEMATIC and PCB variables
3. Any documentation that references file locations

## 📝 Testing Checklist

After pushing the fix, verify:
- [ ] Workflow runs without errors
- [ ] All expected outputs are generated
- [ ] Artifacts can be downloaded
- [ ] Files open correctly (PDFs, PNGs, Gerbers)
- [ ] Local `make` commands work correctly
